1. GetK8SClient:

This function is a helper to create a client that can interact with the Kubernetes API server. It takes the path to your kubeconfig file as input.

First, it uses the clientcmd.BuildConfigFromFlags function to read the kubeconfig file and build a configuration object for the Kubernetes client.
Then, it uses the kubernetes.NewForConfig function to create a new kubernetes.Clientset object using the configuration. This clientset allows us to interact with different Kubernetes resources like namespaces, services, etc.
If there are any errors during these steps, the function returns an error message explaining the issue. Otherwise, it returns the created kubernetes.Clientset object.

2. MakeNamespacePrivilege:

This function allows you to grant special privileges to pods running in a specific Kubernetes namespace. It takes the kubeconfig path and the namespace name as arguments.

It first calls GetK8SClient to get a Kubernetes client.
Then, it tries to retrieve information about the specified namespace using the Namespaces().Get method on the clientset.
If the namespace exists, it adds a specific label (pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce) with the value "privileged" to the namespace object. This label tells Kubernetes to allow pods in this namespace to have more permissions than usual.
Finally, it updates the namespace object in the Kubernetes API server using the Namespaces().Update method.
Any errors encountered during these steps will be returned by the function.

3. CreateNamespaceIfNotExists:

This function ensures a namespace exists in the Kubernetes cluster. It takes the kubeconfig path and the namespace name as arguments.

Similar to the previous functions, it first gets a Kubernetes client using GetK8SClient.
Then, it tries to get information about the namespace using Namespaces().Get.
If the namespace doesn't exist (k8serrors.IsNotFound(err)) it creates a new corev1.Namespace object with the provided namespace name.
The new namespace object is then sent to the Kubernetes API server for creation using Namespaces().Create.
Any errors during these steps will be returned with a formatted message including the namespace name and the specific error details.

4. FetchClusterLoadBalancerHost & FetchNatsLoadBalancerHost:


These functions are very similar. They both retrieve the hostname of a LoadBalancer service running in a specific namespace. They differ slightly in the function names but target the same resource type (Service).

They both get a Kubernetes client using GetK8SClient.
Then, they retrieve information about a service using Services(namespace).Get.
They check if the service type is actually corev1.ServiceTypeLoadBalancer. If it's not a LoadBalancer, they return an error message indicating the service type mismatch.
If it is a LoadBalancer, they check if there's any information in the LoadBalancer.Ingress field of the service object. This field holds details about the external IP address or hostname assigned by the cloud provider.
If there's a valid hostname in LoadBalancer.Ingress, the function extracts and returns it. Otherwise, it returns an empty string and an error message.

## In summary, these functions provide utilities to interact with Kubernetes namespaces, services, and retrieve information about them. Remember, using MakeNamespacePrivilege can be risky as it grants elevated permissions to pods in that namespace. Make sure you understand the security implications before using it.
