## These functions handle OpenEBS CStor pool cluster creation and leverage retries for increased reliability. Let's break them down:

1. getOpenEBSClient:

This function retrieves an OpenEBS API client using the provided captenConfig.
It retrieves the kubeconfig path and builds a Kubernetes client configuration object.
Finally, it creates a new OpenEBS clientset for interacting with the OpenEBS API.
2. getOpenEBSBlockDevices:

This function retrieves a list of block devices suitable for CStor pool creation.
It takes an OpenEBS clientset and captenConfig as arguments.
It retrieves a list of BlockDevice objects from the OpenEBS API for the specified namespace (captenConfig.PoolClusterNamespace).
It iterates through the retrieved block devices, filtering for those with the device type "disk" (presumably disks suitable for storage).
For each valid disk, it extracts the block device name and the node it's attached to.
It creates a map with "blockDevice" and "nodeName" keys and adds it to a list of block device mappings.
It logs information about added and skipped block devices for debugging purposes.
Finally, it returns the list of block device mappings.
3. CreateCStorPoolClusters:

This function is responsible for creating or updating a CStor pool cluster.
It first retrieves an OpenEBS clientset using getOpenEBSClient.
Then, it calls getOpenEBSBlockDevices to get a list of available block devices.
It iterates through the block device mappings, creating individual pool specifications (v1.PoolSpec) for each block device.
Each PoolSpec defines:
NodeSelector: Targets a specific node where the block device is attached.
DataRaidGroups: Defines a single raid group with the retrieved block device.
PoolConfig: Sets the data raid group type (currently "stripe").
It builds a list of all created pool specifications.
It retrieves a CStorPoolCluster client for the target namespace.
It attempts to get the CStorPoolCluster resource with the name specified in captenConfig.PoolClusterName.
If the resource doesn't exist (k8serrors.IsNotFound(err)), it creates a new v1.CStorPoolCluster object with the retrieved pool specifications and creates it in the OpenEBS API using Create.
If the resource exists, it updates the existing CStorPoolCluster object with the new pool specifications (potentially containing new block devices) using Update.
4. retry & CreateCStorPoolClusterWithRetries:

The retry function provides a generic retry mechanism for any function.
It takes the number of retries, the retry interval, and a function to execute as arguments.
It loops for the specified number of retries, attempting to execute the provided function.
If the function execution succeeds (returns no error), the loop exits and the overall function returns successfully.
On any error during execution, the function sleeps for the defined interval before retrying.
CreateCStorPoolClusterWithRetries utilizes retry to create a CStor pool cluster with retries. It attempts creating the pool cluster up to 3 times with a 5-second interval between retries in case of initial failures.

## Overall, these functions provide a way to manage CStor pool clusters in a Kubernetes environment using OpenEBS. They retrieve available block devices, define pool specifications, and create or update the CStor pool cluster resource to utilize these block devices for storage. The retry functionality adds robustness by handling potential transient errors during creation.
