## These new functions provide a more modular and reusable approach to managing namespaces with labels in Kubernetes compared to the previous CreateNamespaceIfNotExists and MakeNamespacePrivilege. Here's a breakdown:

1. Refactored Logic:

The functionality is split into smaller, dedicated functions:
CreateNamespaceIfNotExist: Checks for and creates a namespace if it doesn't exist.
CreateorUpdateNamespaceWithLabel: Checks for a namespace, creates it with labels if missing, or updates labels if it exists.
namespaceExists: Checks if a specific namespace exists in the cluster.
createNamespace: Creates a new namespace object with provided labels.
updateNamespaceLabel: Updates the labels of an existing namespace.

2. Improved Reusability:

These functions operate on separate concerns, making them more reusable in different contexts.
CreateNamespaceIfNotExist can be used for simple namespace creation without label management.
CreateorUpdateNamespaceWithLabel provides a centralized point for ensuring a namespace exists with specific labels.

3. Encapsulated Error Handling:

Each function handles potential errors from Kubernetes API calls and returns them for better error reporting.

4. Consistent Labeling:

The labels map is defined outside the functions, allowing you to modify the set of labels applied to namespaces in one place.

5. Logging:

The functions use clog.Logger.Debugf to log namespace creation or update events with labels for better auditing.
Overall, these functions offer a more organized and efficient way to manage namespaces with labels in your Go program.

Here are some additional points to consider:

The CreateorUpdateNamespaceWithLabel function could be renamed to something more descriptive, like EnsureNamespaceWithLabel.
You might consider adding validation for the provided labels to ensure they conform to Kubernetes naming conventions.
