# GetClusterGlobalValues

This function reads a YAML file containing cluster global values and returns a map of these values. The function takes a file path as an argument and returns a map of string interfaces.

It first attempts to read the file at the provided path using os.ReadFile. If the file does not exist or cannot be read, it returns an error.
It then attempts to unmarshal the file contents into a map of string interfaces using yaml.Unmarshal. If the file is not a valid YAML file or cannot be unmarshaled, it returns an error.
If the file is successfully read and unmarshaled, it returns the map of global values.

# GetApps

This function reads a YAML file containing a list of apps and returns a slice of app names. The function takes a file path and an app type as arguments and returns a slice of strings.

It first attempts to read the file at the provided path using os.ReadFile. If the file does not exist or cannot be read, it returns an error.
It then attempts to unmarshal the file contents into a types.AppList struct using yaml.Unmarshal. If the file is not a valid YAML file or cannot be unmarshaled, it returns an error.
It then checks if the app type is present in the Apps map of the types.AppList struct. If it is not, it returns an error.
If the app type is present, it returns the slice of app names.

#GetAppConfig

This function reads a YAML file containing app configuration and returns an types.AppConfig struct. The function takes a file path and a map of global values as arguments and returns an types.AppConfig struct.

It first attempts to read the file at the provided path using os.ReadFile. If the file does not exist or cannot be read, it returns an error.
It then attempts to unmarshal the file contents into an types.AppConfig struct using yaml.Unmarshal. If the file is not a valid YAML file or cannot be unmarshaled, it returns an error.
If the file is successfully read and unmarshaled, it returns the types.AppConfig struct.

#GetAppValuesTemplate

This function reads a YAML file containing an app values template and returns the file contents as a byte slice. The function takes a config.CaptenConfig struct and an app name as arguments.

It constructs the file path for the app values template file using the PrepareFilePath method of the config.CaptenConfig struct.
It attempts to read the file at the constructed path using os.ReadFile. If the file does not exist or cannot be read, it returns an empty byte slice.
If the file is successfully read, it returns the file contents as a byte slice.

# WriteAppConfig

This function writes an types.AppConfig struct to a YAML file. The function takes a config.CaptenConfig struct and an types.AppConfig struct as arguments.

It attempts to create the directory for the app config file using os.MkdirAll. If the directory cannot be created, it returns an error.
It attempts to marshal the types.AppConfig struct into a YAML file using yaml.Marshal. If the struct cannot be marshaled, it returns an error.
It attempts to write the YAML file to the file system using os.WriteFile. If the file cannot be written, it returns an error.
If the file is successfully written, it returns no error.

# PrepareGlobalVaules

This function reads the cluster global values from a YAML file and returns a map of these values. The function takes a config.CaptenConfig struct as an argument and returns a map of string interfaces.

It calls the GetClusterGlobalValues function to read the cluster global values from the YAML file.
If the file is successfully read, it returns the map of global values.

## Note: The config.CaptenConfig struct is not defined in this code snippet, but it is assumed to contain methods for constructing file paths and other configuration-related functionality.
