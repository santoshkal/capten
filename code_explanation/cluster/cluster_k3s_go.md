## Detailed Code Explanation for k3s functions
This document explains the functionalities of the provided Go code snippets focusing on the k3s package. It utilizes the config.CaptenConfig struct containing various configuration options.

1. getClusterInfo

This function retrieves cluster information based on the cloud service specified in the captenConfig struct.

It checks for two supported cloud services: "aws" and "azure".
For each cloud service, it attempts to call the corresponding function (config.GetClusterInfo or config.GetClusterInfoAzure) to retrieve cluster information from a YAML file located in the config directory defined by captenConfig.PrepareFilePath.
If the cloud service is not supported, an error is returned.
If successful, the retrieved cluster information is returned.
2. createOrDestroyCluster

This function performs the creation or destruction of a k3s cluster based on the provided action ("create" or "destroy").

It logs the action and cloud service details from captenConfig.
It calls getClusterInfo to retrieve cluster information.
Based on the type of cluster information retrieved (either types.AWSClusterInfo or types.AzureClusterInfo), it performs the following steps:
Sets the ConfigFolderPath and TerraformModulesDirPath based on captenConfig.
Calls generateTemplateVarFile to generate a Terraform variable file using the retrieved cluster information and the appropriate template file (captenConfig.AWSTerraformTemplateFileName or captenConfig.AzureTerraformTemplateFileName).
Initializes a new Terraform object (terraform.NewAws or terraform.NewAzure) using the captenConfig and cluster information.
Depending on the action ("create" or "destroy"), it calls the respective Terraform methods (Apply or Destroy) to create or destroy the k3s cluster.
If an unsupported cloud service is encountered, an error is returned.
3. Create & Destroy

These functions are wrappers for createOrDestroyCluster.

Create calls createOrDestroyCluster with the action "create".
Destroy calls createOrDestroyCluster with the action "destroy".
4. generateTemplateVarFile

This function generates a Terraform variable file based on a template and cluster information.

It reads the template content from the specified file path constructed using captenConfig.PrepareFilePath and the template filename (templateFileName).
It parses the template content into a template object.
It creates a new file at the specified path constructed using captenConfig.PrepareFilePath and captenConfig.TerraformVarFileName.
It executes the template object, passing the clusterInfo as data, and writes the output to the newly created file.
If any errors occur during these steps, an error is returned.

### Note: The provided code snippet doesn't show the implementation of the functions from the config package (GetClusterInfo, GetClusterInfoAzure) used to retrieve cluster information. These functions are likely responsible for reading the YAML configuration files and parsing them into the corresponding cluster info structs (types.AWSClusterInfo or types.AzureClusterInfo).
