## These functions provide a wrapper around the Terraform execution using tfexec library for managing infrastructure provisioning on cloud providers like AWS.

1. terraform struct:

This struct encapsulates information and functionalities related to Terraform execution for a specific Capten deployment.
azureconfig: (potentially unused) Holds details for Azure cluster configuration (based on types.AzureClusterInfo).
config: Holds details for the AWS cluster configuration (types.AWSClusterInfo).
exec: Stores a reference to the tfexec.Terraform object used for Terraform command execution.
captenConfig: Holds the overall Capten configuration (config.CaptenConfig).
2. NewAws:

This function creates a new terraform instance specifically for AWS deployments.
It defines an installer object using releases.ExactVersion specifying:
Product: product.Terraform
Version: Fixed version of Terraform (currently set to "1.3.7").
InstallDir: Set to the current directory ("./") for installation.
It uses the installer to install Terraform and retrieves the installation path (execPath). On error, it logs an informative message and returns the error.
It constructs the working directory path based on the Capten configuration for Terraform modules specific to the cloud service, cluster type, and current directory.
It creates a new tfexec.Terraform object with the working directory and Terraform executable path. Sets the logger, standard output, and standard error streams for the Terraform execution.
Finally, it returns a new terraform instance populated with the provided AWS configuration, Terraform exec object, and Capten configuration.
3. initAws:

This function initializes Terraform for the AWS deployment using the configured backend.
It constructs a list of backend configuration options as strings based on the provided AWS credentials and any additional backend configurations specified in t.config.TerraformBackendConfigs.
It creates a slice of tfexec.InitOption objects:
Each option sets a backend configuration option using tfexec.BackendConfig.
Optionally sets tfexec.Upgrade and tfexec.Reconfigure based on flags in captenConfig (potentially for automatic upgrades and reconfiguration).
It calls t.exec.Init with the context and the list of initialization options. On error, it wraps and returns the error.
4. initCommon:

This function serves as a central point for Terraform initialization based on the cloud service specified in captenConfig.
If the cloud service is "azure", it calls t.initAzure (presumably a similar function for Azure initialization, not provided).
Otherwise (assuming AWS), it calls t.initAws for backend initialization.
It returns any errors encountered during initialization.
5. Apply:

This function performs a Terraform apply operation.
It first calls t.initCommon to ensure Terraform is initialized.
It then uses t.exec.Show to display the current Terraform state (informational, can be removed if not required).
It constructs the path to the Terraform variable file based on the Capten configuration directories and the defined variable file name.
It executes t.exec.Plan with the context and a tfexec.VarFile option referencing the variable file for applying the Terraform configuration. On error, it wraps and returns the error.
Finally, it executes t.exec.Apply with the context and the tfexec.VarFile option to apply the Terraform configuration. On error, it wraps and returns the error.
6. Destroy:

This function performs a Terraform destroy operation to remove provisioned infrastructure.
Similar to Apply, it calls t.initCommon for initialization.
It uses t.exec.Show to display the current Terraform state (informational).
It constructs the path to the Terraform variable file.
Finally, it executes t.exec.Destroy with the context and the tfexec.VarFile option referencing the variable file to destroy the infrastructure managed by the Terraform configuration. On error, it wraps and returns the error.

## Overall, these functions provide a structured approach to manage Terraform execution for AWS deployments within the Capten system. They handle Terraform installation, initialization specific to the cloud service, and applying or destroying infrastructure based on the Terraform configuration and provided variables.
