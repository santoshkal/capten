## The provided code defines functions specifically for handling Terraform with Azure deployments in the Capten system.

1. NewAzure:

This function mirrors the logic of NewAws but creates a terraform instance for Azure deployments:

It defines an installer object with releases.ExactVersion specifying:
Product: product.Terraform
Version: Fixed version (currently "1.3.7").
InstallDir: Current directory ("./") for installation.
It installs Terraform and retrieves the installation path (execPath). On error, it logs an informative message and returns the error.
It constructs the working directory path based on the Capten configuration for Terraform modules specific to Azure, cluster type, and current directory.
It creates a new tfexec.Terraform object with the working directory and Terraform executable path. Sets logger, standard output, and standard error streams.
Finally, it returns a new terraform instance populated with the provided Azure configuration, Terraform exec object, and Capten configuration.

2. initAzure:

This function initializes Terraform for the Azure deployment using a backend configured with Azure-specific settings:

It constructs a list of backend configuration options as strings based on the provided Azure cluster information (t.azureconfig). These options define:
Region
Resource group names (Talos, Storage)
Storage account name
Container and cluster names for Talos
It creates a slice of tfexec.InitOption objects similar to initAws:
Each option sets a backend configuration option using tfexec.BackendConfig.
Optionally sets tfexec.Upgrade and tfexec.Reconfigure based on flags in captenConfig.
It calls t.exec.Init with the context and the list of initialization options. On error, it wraps and returns the error.
Key Differences between NewAzure and NewAws:

They use different configuration types (types.AWSClusterInfo vs. types.AzureClusterInfo).
initAzure uses Azure-specific backend configuration options for Terraform initialization.

## These functions demonstrate how the Capten system can handle Terraform deployments for different cloud providers (AWS and Azure in this case) by providing separate functions with cloud-specific configurations.
