Sure, here's a code explanation document for the `agent.go` file in the `pkg/agent` package:

## Overview

The `agent.go` file contains the implementation of the `Agent` struct and the related functions for interacting with the Capten Agent gRPC server.

## Struct: Agent

The `Agent` struct represents a client for the Capten Agent gRPC server. It has the following fields:

- `config`: A `CaptenConfig` struct representing the Capten configuration.
- `client`: A `AgentClient` struct representing the gRPC client for the Agent server.
- `timeout`: A `time.Duration` representing the timeout for gRPC requests.

## Functions

The `agent.go` file contains the following functions:

### GetAgentClient

The `GetAgentClient` function retrieves an `AgentClient` using the provided `CaptenConfig`. It establishes a gRPC connection to the Agent server and returns the `AgentClient` and any error that occurred during the connection.

### NewAgent

The `NewAgent` function creates a new `Agent` struct using the provided `CaptenConfig`. It sets the `config` field to the provided `CaptenConfig` and initializes the `timeout` field to 10 seconds. It then calls the `GetAgentClient` function to retrieve the `AgentClient` and returns the `Agent` struct and any error that occurred during the connection.

### GetApps

The `GetApps` function retrieves the list of apps from the Agent server. It calls the `GetApps` method on the `AgentClient` and returns the list of apps and any error that occurred during the request.

### GetClusterResources

The `GetClusterResources` function retrieves the list of cluster resources from the Agent server. It calls the `GetClusterResources` method on the `AgentClient` and returns the list of cluster resources and any error that occurred during the request.

### GetPluginStore

The `GetPluginStore` function retrieves the list of plugins from the Agent server. It calls the `GetPluginStore` method on the `AgentClient` and returns the list of plugins and any error that occurred during the request.

### GetVaultCreds

The `GetVaultCreds` function retrieves the list of Vault credentials from the Agent server. It calls the `GetVaultCreds` method on the `AgentClient` and returns the list of Vault credentials and any error that occurred during the request.

### ConfigurePlugin

The `ConfigurePlugin` function configures a plugin on the Agent server. It calls the `ConfigurePlugin` method on the `AgentClient` with the provided plugin name and configuration and returns any error that occurred during the request.

### InstallPlugin

The `InstallPlugin` function installs a plugin on the Agent server. It calls the `InstallPlugin` method on the `AgentClient` with the provided plugin name and version and returns any error that occurred during the request.

### UninstallPlugin

The `UninstallPlugin` function uninstalls a plugin from the Agent server. It calls the `UninstallPlugin` method on the `AgentClient` with the provided plugin name and version and returns any error that occurred during the request.

### StoreCred

The `StoreCred` function stores a Vault credential on the Agent server. It calls the `StoreCred` method on the `AgentClient` with the provided credential and returns any error that occurred during the request.

### SyncApps

The `SyncApps` function synchronizes the apps on the Agent server with the apps in the Capten configuration. It calls the `SyncApps` method on the `AgentClient` with the list of apps from the Capten configuration and returns any error that occurred during the request.

### SyncClusterResources

The `SyncClusterResources` function synchronizes the cluster resources on the Agent server with the cluster resources in the Capten configuration. It calls the `SyncClusterResources` method on the `AgentClient` with the list of cluster resources from the Capten configuration and returns any error that occurred during the request.

### SyncPluginStore

The `SyncPluginStore` function synchronizes the plugins on the Agent server with the plugins in the Capten configuration. It calls the `SyncPluginStore` method on the `AgentClient` with the list of plugins from the Capten configuration and returns any error that occurred during the request.

### SyncVaultCreds

The `Sync
